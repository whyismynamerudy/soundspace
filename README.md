a cross-platform mobile application designed for uoft students to discover quiet study spots on campus

notes for devs:
. anytime you pull from github, run the command "npm i" in the terminal to install any new npm packages that are being used
. to run a development server locally, run the command "npm run dev" - this uses nodemon to create a development server that automatically refreshes anytime you make changes locally to your files.
